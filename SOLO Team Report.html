<h1> SOLO TEAM REPORT </h1>
<h4>
    ---Acknowledgements---
    I acknowledge and thank the following people and resources:

    ---Table of Contents---

    ---Introduction---
    Overview of project, summary of team organisation, project management strategy (frequency of meetings,
    internal procedures, etc.). However, you should start this section providing a motivation and a
    rationale for your project (e.g., there was a (partially) unsatisfied need for such and such
    product/service so we developed our stuff that does (more) things or does them better / faster / cheaper
    than the competition.

    ---Background (aka State of the art)---
    Here you should put all what competition (if any) has done so far, so that you can distinguish
    between your new product/service and those already in the market.

    ---Requirements---
    Summary of requirements analysis phase (procedures followed, etc.), current system characterisation,
    functional and non-functional requirements for proposed system, feasibility study. You should base this
    chapter on your CS3028 requirements specification summary.

    ---Design---
    Overview of design, key component designs, data organisation, file/database structure, user-interface design,
    requirements cross-reference, summary of any modifications made to design during later stages of project.
    You should base this chapter on your earlier design summary. It is imperative that you justify all your
    design decisions here.

    ---Coding & Integration---
    Planning for coding & integration of system components, key implementation decisions, libraries used,
    use of existing software, algorithms, etc. We do not expect to see large amounts of code in the report;
    small code fragments may be used to illustrate major decisions, etc.

    Testing and Evaluation
    Testing strategy, description of test data, use of test harness code, test results.
    Evaluation starts from the result of test data to discuss the quality and the limitations of what you have done so far. In particular, you should discuss how well your software fulfils the requirements (and here is where non-functional ones play a major role).
    Conclusions and further work
    Discussion of outcome of project, if original client requirements were not satisfied - explanation of why, possible future changes / additions to the system, lessons learnt.
    Appendices:
    Appendix 1 - User Manual
    Introductory material on how to run the system.
    Appendix 2 - Maintenance Manual
    Description of how to install and compile system, hardware/software dependencies (including libraries), list of source code files (with brief summary of role in system), etc.
    Further appendices (if needed): Copy of material from current system, etc.
