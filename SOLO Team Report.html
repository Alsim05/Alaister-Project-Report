<h1> SOLO TEAM REPORT </h1>
<h4>
    ---Acknowledgements---
    I acknowledge and thank the following people and resources:
    (1) Prof. Vasconcelos - for his moral support, encouragement, wisdom, insight and
        explanations of difficult, tricky concepts (e.g. the differences between
        functional and non-functional requirements, tagging postings, etc.

    (2) Dr. Scharlau - for his moral support, encouragement, knowledge and breaking down
        some difficult concepts and tasks into "bite-sized pieces" that are easier to tackle,
        manage and complete e.g. the task (and concept) of linking several pages together
        in my website.

    (3) Dr. Sharma - for his work behind-the-scenes to help towards me being granted my final
        deadline extension for my Software Engineering Project.

    (4) Prof. Orin - for his work behind-the-scenes that have made my final deadline extension
        for my Software Engineering Project possible.

    (5) My family - for their moral support and encouragement during my preparation of my
        Software Engineering Project.

    ---Introduction---

    Overview of project, summary of team organisation, project management strategy
    (frequency of meetings, internal procedures, etc.). However, you should start
    this section providing a motivation and a rationale for your project (e.g.,
    there was a (partially) unsatisfied need for such and such product/service,
    so we developed our stuff that does (more) things or does them
    better / faster / cheaper than the competition.

    ---Background (aka State of the art)---
    Here you should put all what competition (if any) has done so far, so that you
    can distinguish between your new product/service and those already in the market.

    ---Requirements---

    Summary of requirements analysis phase (procedures followed, etc.), current
    system characterisation, functional and non-functional requirements for
    proposed system, feasibility study. You should base this chapter on your
    CS3028 requirements specification summary.

    ---Design---

    Overview of design, key component designs, data organisation, file/database structure,
    user-interface design, requirements cross-reference, summary of any modifications
    made to design during later stages of project. You should base this chapter on your
    earlier design summary. It is imperative that you justify all your design decisions here.

    ---Coding & Integration---

    Planning for coding & integration of system components, key implementation decisions,
    libraries used, use of existing software, algorithms, etc. We do not expect to see
    large amounts of code in the report; small code fragments may be used to illustrate
    major decisions, etc.

    ---Testing & Evaluation---

    Testing strategy, description of test data, use of test harness code, test results.
    Evaluation starts from the result of test data to discuss the quality and the
    limitations of what you have done so far. In particular, you should discuss how well
    your software fulfils the requirements (and here is where non-functional ones play a
    major role).

    ---Conclusions and further work---

    Discussion of outcome of project, if original client requirements were not satisfied -
    explanation of why, possible future changes / additions to the system, lessons learnt.

    ---Appendices:---

    Appendix 1 - User Manual
    In this section, you should provide some introductory material on how to run your
    Software System.

    Appendix 2 - Maintenance Manual
    In this section, you should provide a description of (1) how to install and compile
    your Software System, (2) hardware/software dependencies (including libraries),
    (3) list of source code files (with brief summary of role in your SW System), etc.

    Further appendices (if needed): Copy of material from current system, etc.
